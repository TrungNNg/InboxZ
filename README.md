InboxZ is a productivity app that aim to combat procrastination and preserve mental energy by help users start their task. The truth is that everybody procrastinate, and everybody hate procrastinating. The most popular TED Talk on YouTube is about procrastination. I also struggle with procrastination myself so I have tried multiple productivity tools that available in the AppStore. Productivity tools like time planner, habit tracker, todo list, daily reminder, meditation, Pomodoro and distraction blocking app, I have tried them all and get very little result. Then I come across this post by Eliezer Yudkowsky. The post is very short, but it describe exactly what procrastination is about, it is the difficult to start a task. The entire point of existence of InboxZ is to help you start your task.
